### A screen saver ecosystem for Linux (tested on Ubuntu 25.04)
The key here is a script (from https://gist.github.com/vdbsh/a9f0723708a4393d42a0d768d831c4df) that will run a given program as a screen saver.

I then scrounged a bunch of Python/PyGame screen saver apps and incporporated them, legitimately I hope.


### Requirements
 * PyGame
 
### Things to do
 * Make every module use the full screen, and the same 'cancel' key.
